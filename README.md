# -Metasploit---My-Learning-Notes-on-Penetration-Testing-with-Metasploit-Framework-Pro


Hello everyone! 👋  
In this repository, I’m sharing my personal learning notes and summaries about one of the most powerful penetration testing tools in the cybersecurity world: **Metasploit**.

Throughout my cybersecurity training, I’ve spent significant time exploring both **Metasploit Framework** and **Metasploit Pro**, and here’s what I’ve learned so far 👇

---

## 🌟 What is Metasploit?

Metasploit is a widely used open-source penetration testing framework, originally created by **HD Moore in 2003** and later acquired by **Rapid7 in 2009**.

It has become an essential tool for:

- ✅ Ethical Hackers  
- ✅ Penetration Testers  
- ✅ Security Researchers  
- ✅ Vulnerability Assessors  

Metasploit allows users to **identify, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities** in target systems.

## 🛠️ Main Components of Metasploit

### 1. Metasploit Framework (MSF)

This is the **free and open-source** version.  
It provides a command-line-based environment, primarily accessed through **MSFConsole**.

**Core Components:**

- **Exploit Modules** – Code to trigger vulnerabilities
- **Payloads** – Code executed after exploitation (e.g., shells, Meterpreter)
- **Auxiliary Modules** – Scanners, fuzzers, DoS tools, etc.
- **Post-Exploitation Modules** – Tools for maintaining access and collecting info
- **Encoders & NOPs** – Bypass signature-based defenses
- **Meterpreter** – Advanced, memory-resident payload for post-exploitation tasks

### 2. Metasploit Pro

This is the **commercial version**, mainly for professional use.  
It provides a **Web GUI** along with many advanced features not available in the Framework version.

**Key Features of Metasploit Pro:**

- ✔️ Automated Task Chains  
- ✔️ Social Engineering Tools (Phishing Campaigns)  
- ✔️ Vulnerability Validation  
- ✔️ Integration with Nexpose for vulnerability scanning  
- ✔️ Advanced Reporting Tools  
- ✔️ Web-based and Command-line interfaces

## 💻 Working with MSFConsole

The **MSFConsole** is the primary CLI tool for interacting with Metasploit Framework.

### 📌 Basic Commands I’ve Learned:

| Command        | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `msfconsole`   | Launches Metasploit Framework        |
| `search`       | Search for modules, exploits, etc.   |
| `use`          | Load a specific module               |
| `info`         | Get detailed info about a module     |
| `options`      | Show required module parameters      |
| `set` / `get`  | Configure module options             |
| `unset`        | Clear module options                 |
| `show`         | List exploits, payloads, etc.        |
| `sessions`     | List active sessions                 |
| `history`      | View command history                 |
| `back`         | Exit from current module             |

## 🚀 Exploitation Workflow Example:

1. **Information Gathering** – Using auxiliary scanners  
2. **Vulnerability Discovery** – Identify weaknesses  
3. **Exploitation** – Launching exploits  
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Maintaining access & data extraction  
5. **Reporting** – Documenting findings

## 🧱 Common Payload Types:

- **Bind Shell** – Starts a listener on the target
- **Reverse Shell** – Target connects back to attacker
- **Meterpreter** – Fully interactive payload
- **Shellcode** – Custom commands execution
